# Prospero: Render text on the web as a book

> To work mine end upon their senses that<br/>
> This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff,<br/>
> Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,<br/>
> And deeper than did ever plummet sound<br/>
> I’ll drown my book.<br/>

- Prospero, _The Tempest_ by William Shakespeare

As Prospero set aside his books, forsaking their awesome powers, so we shall set aside physical books for electronic ones.

This is a work in progress. I am researching how feasible the concept is.

After installing node dependencies, `yarn start` can be ran to see various experiments in how the browser renders text.
